# ALU with Finite State Machine (FSM) Controller

## Project Overview üíª
This project implements a fundamental **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** controlled by a dedicated **Finite State Machine (FSM)**.  
The entire system is designed and synthesized using **VHDL** (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) and the **Intel Quartus Prime** software environment.  

It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of designing and integrating basic computer architecture components ‚Äî combining both data path elements (the ALU and registers) and control path logic (the FSM).

## Key Components and Design Structure ‚öôÔ∏è
The system is modular, with each core function implemented as a separate VHDL entity, as seen in the file structure:

### 1. The Data Path (ALU and Registers)
The data path handles the actual data processing.

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) and logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, XOR).  
- **Registers (DFF_Latch, DFF_B, DFF_A):** Store input data (A and B) and the output/accumulator (Acc) based on control signals from the FSM.  
- **Multiplexers (MUX_Gates):** Select data inputs for the ALU based on the FSM's control signals (SEL).

### 2. The Control Path (Finite State Machine ‚Äì FSM.vhd)
The FSM is the **central control unit** of the entire system.

- **Function:** Dictates the sequence of operations by generating all necessary control signals.  
- **Inputs:** `clock`, `reset`, `start`, `accumulate` (from the user/external environment).  
- **Outputs:** `State_Out` (the 3-bit control word), `WR_A`, `WR_B`, `WR_C` (Write-Enable signals for the registers), and `SEL` (Selector for the multiplexers).  
- **States:** The FSM typically sequences through states such as **init**, **fetch**, **proc** (process/execute), and **write_ot** (write output).  
  Each state corresponds to a specific step in an instruction cycle and sets a unique combination of control output signals.

## FSM State Sequence (High-Level) üß≠
The FSM controls the system's operation cycle, which generally follows these steps:

1. **init (State 000):**  
   The default idle state. Waits for a start signal.  

2. **fetch (State 001):**  
   Loads the initial operands from inputs into the A and B registers (controlled by `WR_A` and `WR_B`).  
   `State_Out` is set to `001`.  

3. **proc (State 010):**  
   Executes the ALU operation on the loaded data.  
   `State_Out` is set to `010`.  

4. **write_ot (State 100):**  
   Writes the result from the ALU output into the **Accumulator/Output Register** (Acc controlled by `WR_C`).  
   `State_Out` is set to `100`. The FSM then transitions back to the **init** state or repeats based on a signal such as **accumulate**.

## Implementation Details and Technology üõ†Ô∏è
- **Language:** VHDL  
- **Platform:** Intel Quartus Prime (64-bit)  
- **Design Flow:** The individual VHDL components are integrated using the **Quartus Block Diagram/Schematic Editor** (`Final_Project_ALU.bdf`) to form the complete top-level circuit, ensuring correct signal routing and component instantiation.

This project provides a strong foundation for understanding the operational principles of a **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** ‚Äî where a dedicated control unit (like this FSM) orchestrates the flow of data through the execution units (like the ALU and registers).
